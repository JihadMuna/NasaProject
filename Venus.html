        <p>
          Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus's thick atmosphere traps
          heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in
          our solar system.

          <em>Venus</em> is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s
          closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial
          (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
          similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however –
          there are radical differences between the two worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Venus</em> has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide
          and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric
          acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the
          hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to
          the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees
          Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The
          surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched
          mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s
          possible some volcanoes are still active.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Venus</em>
           has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of
          Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean
          on Earth.
