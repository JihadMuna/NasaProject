        <p>
          Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus's thick atmosphere traps
          heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in
          our solar system.

        <p>
          Saturn is a captivating gas giant, the sixth planet from the Sun in
          our solar system. Saturn's claim to fame is its magnificent ring
          system, consisting of countless icy and rocky particles that encircle
          the planet, creating a breathtaking celestial spectacle. This colossal
          planet is the second-largest in our solar system, with a diameter of
          about 116,464 kilometers (72,367 miles).

        <p>
          Pluto is a dwarf planet in our solar system. It was once considered
          the ninth planet, but its classification was changed in 2006 by the
          International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to its small size and its
          location in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond
          Neptune that contains many small icy objects.
