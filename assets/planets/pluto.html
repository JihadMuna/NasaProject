        Pluto is a dwarf planet in our solar system. 
        It was once considered the ninth planet, 
        but its classification was changed in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to its small size and its location in the Kuiper Belt, a 
        region of the solar system beyond Neptune that contains many small icy objects.

        Here are some key facts about Pluto:
        
        1. Size: Pluto is relatively small, with a diameter of approximately 2,377 kilometers (1,474 miles). 
        This makes it much smaller than the eight major planets in our solar system.
        
        2. Orbit: Pluto orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 5.9 billion kilometers (3.67 billion miles). 
        Its orbit is highly elliptical, which means it can get much closer to the Sun at certain points in its orbit.
        
        3. Composition: Pluto is composed primarily of rock and ice. 
        It has a thin atmosphere primarily made up of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.
        
        4. Moons: Pluto has five known moons. The largest of these is Charon, which is about half the size of Pluto itself. 
        The other four moons are much smaller and are named Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.
        
        5. Discovery: Pluto was discovered in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. 
        It was the first object to be discovered in the Kuiper Belt.
        
        6. Demotion to Dwarf Planet: In 2006, the IAU reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet, 
        citing its small size and the fact that it had not cleared its orbit of other debris, 
        which is one of the criteria for being considered a full-fledged planet.
