            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
                Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape
                Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold.
                 The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.
